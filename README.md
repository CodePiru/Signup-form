# Signup-form

Hi, this is my Sign-up form project from The Odin Project (TOP).

In here, I'll show what I learned with forms regarding to the client-side, I'll try to make some validations with HTML and a little JavaScript, trying to make custom error messages. I also plan to make a Success dummy page.
